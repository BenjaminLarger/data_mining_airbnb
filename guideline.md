# Data Mining Guideline

## 1. Understand the Problem and Define Objectives
- Clearly define what you're trying to predict: Price of Airbnb listings.
- Identify deliverables:
	- Trained models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression.
	- Key variables influencing prices.
	- Evaluation of model performances.
	- Address overfitting/underfitting issues.

## 2. Prepare the Dataset
- **Data Collection**: Ensure you have access to a relevant dataset containing features like location, reviews, availability, room type, etc.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
	- Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships between features and the target variable.
	- Check for missing or inconsistent data.
- **Data Cleaning**:
	- Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion).
	- Normalize or standardize features if needed (especially for regression models).
- **Feature Engineering**:
	- Create or modify variables to improve predictive power (e.g., encode location into numerical clusters).
	- Use statistical tests or feature importance methods to select relevant features.

## 3. Modeling
- **Baseline Model**:
	- Start with a simple Linear Regression model to establish a baseline for comparison.
- **Advanced Models**:
	- Implement Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
	- Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, or RÂ² for regression.
- **Cross-validation**:
	- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70%-15%-15%).
	- Use k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Approach**:
	- Perform Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization.
- **Key hyperparameters to tune**:
	- Random Forest: Number of trees, max depth, max features.
	- Gradient Boosting: Learning rate, max depth, number of estimators, subsample.
	- Linear Regression: Regularization parameters if applying Ridge or Lasso.
- **Tools**:
	- Use libraries like GridSearchCV from scikit-learn or Optuna for automated optimization.

## 5. Evaluate and Address Model Bias
- **Evaluation**:
	- Use the test set to evaluate final model performance.
	- Analyze residuals to check for patterns indicating bias.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting**:
	- Adjust model complexity (e.g., tree depth, regularization parameters).
	- Use techniques like early stopping (for Gradient Boosting).
	- If overfitting persists, increase training data size or apply feature reduction.

## 6. Results and Documentation
- **Write Report**:
	- Introduction: Context and problem statement.
	- Data Description: Variables and their roles.
	- Methodology: EDA, modeling approach, and hyperparameter tuning.
	- Results: Performance metrics and comparative analysis.
	- Challenges: Overfitting, data imbalance, etc.
	- Conclusion: Summary of findings and future work suggestions.
- **Code Structure**:
	- Organize your scripts or notebook:
		- Data preprocessing.
		- Model implementation.
		- Hyperparameter tuning.
		- Evaluation and visualization.
	- Provide a README file for instructions on running the code.

## 7. Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**:
	- EDA and Visualization: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
	- Modeling: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
	- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV, Optuna.
- Use Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step analysis and visualization.

## 8. Bonus Suggestions
- **Scalability**:
	- If the dataset is large, consider using Big Data tools like Apache Spark or Dask.
- **Feature Importance**:
	- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability.
- **Data Imbalance**:
	- Balance the dataset if some locations dominate.
- **Model Ensemble**:
	- Combine predictions from multiple models for better accuracy.

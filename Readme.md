# Weather Prediction Project

## Introduction  

This project predicts weather patterns using advanced machine learning models. By selecting a city, the program provides insights into temperature trends, precipitation levels, and other weather variables. The prediction system employs models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, each evaluated based on their performance metrics.

## Features  

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Access the application via a web browser to make predictions.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, and KNN.  
- **Real-time Compilation**: Automatically compiles and launches upon selection of a city.  
- **Performance Metrics**: View model evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²) within the interface.
